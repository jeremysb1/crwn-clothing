I built an E-commerce store to teach myself React. 

This is a full-stack application built with JavaScript, React, Redux, Hooks, and Node. The store also uses the Stripe Checkout API to handle secure payments. Lastly, the application uses OAuth for secure signin with Google by using Firesbase and uses the Firestore NoSQL database for user and other data.
